  "title": "Adaptive Augmentation via Constrained RL for Cross-Site Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Classification",
  "description": "A constraint-aware reinforcement learning framework in which a PPO agent learns to select radiologically bounded augmentations adaptively for pneumonia classification. Trained on 191,027 CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR images, achieving 97.23% accuracy, AUC 0.981, and ECE 0.016.",
